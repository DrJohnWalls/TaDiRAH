TaDiRAH - Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities (v. 0.5.1, 05/2014)

TaDiRAH is usually pronounced "ta-DEE-ra" and is not an animal. However, DiRT and DARIAH are both partial anagrams of it.

In addition to the current human-readable version of the taxonomy, we are planning to publish machine-readable formats of it.
