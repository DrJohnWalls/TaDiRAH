TaDiRAH - Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities (v. 0.5.1, 05/2014)
=====================================================================================

This taxonomy of digital research activities in the humanities has been developed for use by community-driven sites and projects that aim to structure information relevant to digital humanities and make it more easily discoverable. The taxonomy is expected to be particularly useful to endeavors aiming to collect information on digital humanities tools, methods, projects, or readings.

Good to know

If you have comments on the taxonomy, please use the issue tracker here on GitHub. You are welcome to fork and reuse the taxonomy in your project. Please tell us about it!

TaDiRAH is usually pronounced "ta-DEE-ra" and is not an animal. However, DiRT and DARIAH are both partial anagrams of it.

In addition to the current human-readable version of the taxonomy, we are planning to publish machine-readable formats of it.
